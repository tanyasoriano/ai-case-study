# CASE STUDY OF MIDJOURNEY
## Overview and Origin
Midjourney is a powerful, easy to use, generative AI tool that has forever changed how humans work to create digital art. Utilizing simple text prompts, users are able to partner with Midjourney to create visual art that is unique and evocative. Led by David Holz, Midjourney has a business model and philosophy that has proven successful. 

David Holz, CEO and founder, launched the company in July 2022. An American entrepreneur, Holz studied math and physics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He first founded Leap Motion in 2008, a company that developed technology for registering hand motions and gestures as input. Holz sold Leap Motion in 2019 for $30 million. 

After moving to San Francisco, Holz closely monitored developments in AI and advancements in diffusion models. “After Leap Motion, Holz started wondering about what the future would look like, and what people would need in this uncertain future. He came up with 3 pillars for what he thought would be the most important: reflection, imagination, and coordination.” (1)

Holz’s experience with Leap Motion impacted and shaped his future business model with Midjourney – he knew he did not want to rely on investors which would then either directly or indirectly influence the operation. Midjourney is entirely independent and has received no venture capitalist funding. They initially started with less than 20 employees and no brick-and-mortar headquarters. They have since increased their employee count to a little over 100 as of August 2024. In 2023 alone, Midjourney’s revenue is estimated at $200 million based off user subscriptions. However, financial experts estimate the company’s worth at $10 billion. (2)

## Business Activities
Midjourney offers visual art generated by text prompts quickly, saving time and improving artist efficiency and creativity.

> “We like to say we’re trying to expand the imaginative powers of the human species. The goal is to make humans more imaginative, not make imaginative machines, which I think is an important distinction."
> -David Holz (3)

Midjourney has a wide range of intended customers which includes professional artists and designers, film and animation studios, interior designers, architecture firms, video game developers, content creators, marketing firms and businesses, and amateur digital art enthusiasts who simply enjoy the experience of creating digital art. According to an interview with David Holz in The Register in 2022, 70% of their customers are nonprofessional artists. "The majority of people are just having fun," said Holz. "I think that's the biggest thing because it's not actually about art, it's about imagination." (4)
